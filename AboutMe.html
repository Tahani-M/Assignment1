      <h1>About me</h1> 
	 	<p>Hello again everyone. Thanks for visiting my site. I just wanted to tell you a little about myself. I was born in
	   Calfornia and lived here most of my life. It is a nice place to live because of it's diverse topography. For example,
	   within a three hour drive of Los Angeles you can find ski resorts, the desert, mountains, farm land, and beaches. Please click

	living in Californina. </div> <br />

	<h2>My Background</h2>

	<p> I have a tech support background. I worked in a 24/7/365 tech support enviroment. I also worked on a Mac OSX Deployment and Windows 10 Deployments. 
	    However, the role that got me interested in coding was my Business Analyst role. With this role, I got to learn how to read XML and JSON Files, I 
	    interactedbwith developers on a daily basis, this gave me some insight on what developers do. I learned also learned about testing such system,
	    functional, UAT, regression, and blackbox testing. My hobbies include researching new recipes, watching youtube, and exploring Chicago.

         <h3> Why do I want to become a web develeper</h3>
	      I am interested in becoming a developer because it is fun. You can alter the images, image, font background, etc of a website. You can always make the
	      better. Although, I do enjoy web development, I want to learn python, as it is a powerful language. It is used is data science, scientic research, networking,
	      among other things.
